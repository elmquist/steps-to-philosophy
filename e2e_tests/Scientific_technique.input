A '''scientific technique''' is any [[systematic process|systematic]] way of obtaining [[information]] about a [[science|scientific]] nature or to obtain a [[Desire (emotion)|desired]] material or [[Product (business)|product]].

Scientific techniques can be divided in many different groups, e.g.:

# Preparative techniques
## Synthesis techniques, e.g. the use of Grignard reagents in organic chemistry
## Growth techniques, e.g. [[crystal growth]] or [[cell culture]]s in biology
## Purification techniques e.g. [[List of purification methods in chemistry|those in chemistry]]
# Measurement techniques
## Analysis techniques, e.g. ones that reveal atomic or molecular composition.
## Characterization techniques, e.g. ones that measure a certain property of a material.
## Imaging techniques, e.g. [[microscopy]]

In some cases these methods have evolved into instrumental techniques that require expensive equipment. This is particularly true in sciences like [[physics]], [[chemistry]], and [[astronomy]]. It is customary to abbreviate the names of techniques into acronyms, although this does not hold for all of them. Particularly the advent of the computer has led to a true proliferation in the number of techniques to the point that few scientists still have a good overview over all that is available. See, for example, the [[list of materials analysis methods]] and [[:Category:Scientific techniques]].
