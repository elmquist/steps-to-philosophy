'''Ethology''' is the [[scientific method|scientific]] and objective study of animal behaviour,  usually with a focus on behaviour under natural conditions, and viewing behaviour as an evolutionarily adaptive trait.<ref>{{cite web|title=Definition of ethology|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ethology|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=9 September 2016}}</ref> [[Behaviourism]] is a term that also describes the scientific and objective study of animal behaviour, usually referring to measured responses to stimuli or trained behavioural responses in a [[laboratory]] context, without a particular emphasis on evolutionary adaptivity.<ref>{{cite web|title=Definition of behaviorism|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/behaviorism|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=9 September 2016}}<br>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/behaviourism|title=Behaviourism|publisher=Oxford Dictionaries|accessdate=9 September 2016}}</ref> Many naturalists have studied aspects of animal behaviour throughout history. Ethology has its scientific roots in the work of [[Charles Darwin]] and of American and German ornithologists of the late 19th and early 20th century, including [[Charles Otis Whitman|Charles O. Whitman]], [[Oskar Heinroth]], and [[Wallace Craig]]. The modern discipline of ethology is generally considered to have begun during the 1930s with the work of Dutch biologist [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]] and by Austrian biologists [[Konrad Lorenz]] and [[Karl von Frisch]], joint awardees of the 1973 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1973/index.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1973|work=Nobelprize.org.|accessdate=9 September 2016|quote="The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1973 was awarded jointly to Karl von Frisch, Konrad Lorenz and Nikolaas Tinbergen 'for their discoveries concerning organization and elicitation of individual and social behaviour patterns'."}}</ref> Ethology is a combination of laboratory and field science, with a strong relation to some other disciplines such as [[neuroanatomy]], [[ecology]], and [[evolutionary biology]]. Ethologists are typically interested in a behavioural process rather than in a particular animal group, and often study one type of behaviour, such as [[Animal aggression|aggression]], in a number of unrelated animals.

Ethology is a rapidly growing field. Since the dawn of the 21st century, many aspects of [[animal communication]], [[emotion in animals|emotions]], [[animal culture|culture]], [[learning]] and [[animal sexuality|sexuality]] that the scientific community long thought it understood have been re-examined, and new conclusions reached. New fields, such as [[neuroethology]], have developed.

Understanding ethology or animal behaviour can be important in [[animal training]]. Considering the natural behaviours of different species or breeds enables the trainer to select the individuals best suited to perform the required task. It also enables the trainer to encourage the performance of naturally occurring behaviours and also the discontinuance of undesirable behaviours.<ref name="McGreevyBoakes2011">{{cite book|last1=McGreevy|first1=Paul|author2=Robert Boakes|title=Carrots and Sticks: Principles of Animal Training|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AG_fdrmUKroC&pg=PR11|accessdate=9 September 2016|year=2011|publisher=Darlington Press|isbn=978-1-921364-15-0|pages=xi–23}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The term ''ethology'' derives from the [[Greek language]]: [[wiktionary:ἦθος|ἦθος]], ''[[ethos]]'' meaning "character" and {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:-λογία|-λογία]]}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'' meaning "the study of".  The term was first popularized by American [[myrmecologist]] (a person who studies ants) [[William Morton Wheeler]] in 1902.<ref name=insectbehavior>{{cite book|last1=Matthews|first1=Janice R.|author2=Robert W. Matthews|title=Insect Behaviour|page=13|year=2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-90-481-2388-9}}</ref> An earlier, slightly different sense of the term was proposed by [[John Stuart Mill]] in his 1843 ''System of Logic''.<ref name="Bourg2007">{{cite book|last=Bourg|first=Julian|title=From Revolution to Ethics: May 1968 and Contemporary French Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z3blPfLngAEC|year=2007|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=978-0-7735-7621-6|page=155}}</ref> He recommended the development of a new science, "ethology", the purpose of which would be explanation of individual and national differences in character, on the basis of [[associationism|associationistic]] [[psychology]]. This use of the word was never adopted.

==Relationship with comparative psychology==
[[Comparative psychology]] also studies animal behaviour, but, as opposed to ethology, is construed as a sub-topic of [[psychology]] rather than as one of [[biology]]. Historically, where comparative psychology has included research on animal behaviour in the context of what is known about human psychology, ethology involves research on animal behaviour in the context of what is known about animal [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[neurobiology]], and [[phylogenetic]] history. Furthermore, early comparative psychologists concentrated on the study of learning and tended to research behaviour in artificial situations, whereas early ethologists concentrated on behaviour in natural situations, tending to describe it as instinctive.

The two approaches are complementary rather than competitive, but they do result in different perspectives, and occasionally conflicts of opinion about matters of substance. In addition, for most of the twentieth century, comparative psychology developed most strongly in [[North America]], while ethology was stronger in [[Europe]]. From a practical standpoint, early comparative psychologists concentrated on gaining extensive knowledge of the behaviour of very few [[species]]. Ethologists were more interested in understanding behaviour across a wide range of species to facilitate principled comparisons across [[alpha taxonomy|taxonomic]] groups. Ethologists have made much more use of such cross-species comparisons than comparative psychologists have.

== History ==

===''Scala naturae'' and Lamarck's theories===
{{Refimprove|date=May 2010}}
[[File:Jean-baptiste lamarck2.jpg|right|200 px|thumb|[[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] (1744–1829)]]

''See also:  [[Great Chain of Being]]''

Until the 19th century, the most common theory among scientists was still the concept of ''[[Great chain of being|scala naturae]]'', proposed by [[Aristotle]]. According to this theory, living beings were classified on an ideal pyramid that represented non-living things (such as minerals and sediment) and the simplest animals on the lower levels, with complexity increasing progressively towards the top, occupied by human beings. In the Western world of the time, people believed animal species were eternal and immutable, created with a specific purpose, as this seemed the only possible explanation for the incredible variety of living beings and their surprising adaptation to their habitats.<ref name=insectbehavior/>

[[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] (1744 - 1829) was the first biologist to describe a complex theory of evolution. His theory substantially comprised two statements: first, that animal organs and behaviour can change according to the way they are used; and second, that those characteristics can transmit from one generation to the next (the example of the [[giraffe]] whose neck becomes longer while trying to reach the upper leaves of a tree is well-known). The second statement is that every living organism, humans included, tends to reach a greater level of perfection. When [[Charles Darwin]] went to the [[Galapagos Islands]],  he was well aware of Lamarck's theories and was influenced by them.

===Theory of evolution by natural selection and the beginnings of ethology===
[[File:Charles Darwin 1880.jpg|right|200 px|thumb|[[Charles Darwin]] (1809–1882)]]
Because ethology is considered a topic of biology, ethologists have been concerned particularly with the [[evolution]] of behaviour and the understanding of behaviour in terms of the theory of [[natural selection]]. In one sense, the first modern ethologist was [[Charles Darwin]], whose book ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'' influenced many ethologists. He pursued his interest in behaviour by encouraging his protégé [[George Romanes]], who investigated animal learning and intelligence using an [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] method, [[anecdotal cognitivism]], that did not gain scientific support.

Other early ethologists, such as Charles O. Whitman, [[Oskar Heinroth]], Wallace Craig and [[Julian Huxley]], instead concentrated on behaviours that can be called instinctive, or natural, in that they occur in all members of a species under specified circumstances. Their beginning for studying the behaviour of a new species was to construct an '''[[ethogram]]''' (a description of the main types of behaviour with their frequencies of occurrence).<ref name=insectbehavior />  This provided an objective, cumulative data-base of behaviour, which subsequent researchers could check and supplement.

===Social ethology and recent developments===
In 1970, the [[England|English]] ethologist John H. Crook published an important paper in which he distinguished comparative ethology from social ethology, and argued that much of the ethology that had existed so far was really comparative ethology—examining animals as individuals—whereas, in the future, ethologists would need to concentrate on the behaviour of social groups of animals and the social structure within them.

Also in 1970, [[Robert Ardrey]]'s book ''The Social Contract: A Personal Inquiry into the Evolutionary Sources of Order and Disorder'' was published.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ardrey|first=Robert|title=The Social Contract: A Personal Inquiry into the Evolutionary Sources of Order and Disorder|year=1970|publisher=Atheneum}}</ref> The book and study investigated animal behaviour and then compared human behaviour to it as a similar phenomenon.

[[E. O. Wilson]]'s book ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]'' appeared in 1975, and since that time, the study of behaviour has been much more concerned with social aspects. It has also been driven by the stronger, but more sophisticated, Darwinism associated with Wilson, Robert Trivers, and William Hamilton. The related development of [[behavioural ecology]] has also helped transform ethology. Furthermore, a substantial reapprochement with comparative psychology has occurred, so the modern scientific study of behaviour offers a more or less seamless spectrum of approaches: from [[animal cognition]] to more traditional [[comparative psychology]], ethology, [[sociobiology]], and behavioural ecology.

===Growth of the field===
Due to the work of Lorenz and Tinbergen, ethology developed strongly in continental Europe during the years prior to [[World War II]].<ref name=insectbehavior /> After the war, Tinbergen moved to the [[University of Oxford]], and ethology became stronger in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], with the additional influence of [[William Homan Thorpe|William Thorpe]], [[Robert Hinde]], and [[Patrick Bateson]] at the Sub-department of Animal Behaviour of the [[University of Cambridge]], located in the village of [[Madingley]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Bateson|first=P.|title=The Development and Integration of Behaviour: Essays in Honour of Robert Hinde|page=479|isbn=978-0-521-40709-0|year=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref> In this period, too, ethology began to develop strongly in [[North America]].

Lorenz, Tinbergen, and von Frisch were jointly awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1973 for their work of developing ethology.<ref>{{cite book|author=Encyclopaedia Britannica|title=Yearbook of science and the future|year=1975|page=248}}</ref>

Ethology is now a well-recognized scientific discipline, and has a number of journals covering developments in the subject, such as ''[[Animal Behaviour (journal)|Animal Behaviour]]'', ''[[Animal Welfare (journal)|Animal Welfare]]'', ''[[Applied Animal Behaviour Science]]'', ''[[Behaviour (journal)|Behaviour]]'', ''[[Behavioral Ecology (journal)|Behavioral Ecology]]'' and ''[[Journal of Ethology (journal)|Journal of Ethology]]''. In 1972, the [http://ishe.org/ International Society for Human Ethology] was founded to promote exchange of knowledge and opinions concerning human behaviour gained by applying ethological principles and methods and published their journal, ''[http://ishe.org/human-ethology-bulletin/ The Human Ethology Bulletin]''. In 2008, in a paper published in the journal ''Behaviour'', ethologist Peter Verbeek introduced the term "Peace Ethology" as a sub-discipline of Human Ethology that is concerned with issues of human conflict, conflict resolution, reconciliation, war, peacemaking, and peacekeeping behaviour.<ref>Verbeek, Peter. (2008) "Peace Ethology." Behaviour 145, 1497-1524</ref>

Today, along with ethologists, many biologists, zoologists, primatologists, anthropologists, veterinarians, and physicians study ethology and other related fields such as animal psychology, the study of animal social groups, animal cognition and [[animal welfare science]].

==Instinct==
[[File:Larus Dominicanus with young.jpg|right|thumb|[[Kelp gull]] chicks peck at red spot on mother's beak to stimulate regurgitating reflex]]
The [[Webster's Dictionary|Merriam-Webster dictionary]] defines [[instinct]] as "A largely inheritable and unalterable tendency of an organism to make a complex and specific response to environmental stimuli without involving reason".<ref name="Merriam">{{cite web|publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|title=Instinct|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/instinct}}</ref>

===Fixed action patterns===
{{main|Fixed action pattern}}
An important development, associated with the name of Konrad Lorenz though probably due more to his teacher, [[Oskar Heinroth]], was the identification of [[fixed action pattern]]s (FAPs). Lorenz popularized FAPs as instinctive responses that would occur reliably in the presence of identifiable stimuli called sign stimuli or [[Releaser|"releasing stimuli"]].  FAPs are now considered to be instinctive behavioural sequences that are relatively invariant within the species and almost inevitably run to completion.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Campbell, N. A.]]|year=1996|title=Biology|edition=4|chapter=Chapter 50|publisher=Benjamin Cummings, New York|ISBN= 0-8053-1957-3}}</ref>

One example of a releaser is the [[beak]] movements of many bird species performed by newly hatched chicks, which stimulates the mother to regurgitate food for her offspring.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bernstein|first=W M|title=A Basic Theory of Neuropsychoanalysis|year=2011|publisher=Karnac Books|isbn=978-1-85575-809-4|page=81}}</ref>  Other examples are the classic studies by Tinbergen on the [[Fixed action pattern egg-retrieval behaviour|egg-retrieval behaviour]] and the effects of a "[[supernormal stimulus]]" on the behaviour of [[Graylag goose|graylag geese]].<ref>{{Cite book|author=[[Niko Tinbergen|Tinbergen, N.]] |year=1951 |title=The Study of Instinct |publisher=Oxford University Press, New York.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Tinbergen, N.|year=1953|title=The Herring Gull's World|publisher=Collins, London}}</ref> 
   
One investigation of this kind was the study of the [[waggle dance]] ("dance language") in [[bee learning and communication|bee communication]] by [[Karl von Frisch]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Buchmann|first=Stephen|title=Letters from the Hive: An Intimate History of Bees, Honey, and Humankind|year=2006|publisher=Random House of Canada|isbn=978-0-553-38266-2|page=105}}</ref> Lorenz subsequently developed a theory of the evolution of animal communication based on his observations of fixed action patterns and the circumstances in which they are expressed.

==Learning==

===Habituation===
{{Main|Habituation}}
Habituation is a simple form of learning and occurs in many animal taxa.  It is the process whereby an animal ceases responding to a stimulus.  Often, the response is an innate behaviour.  Essentially, the animal learns not to respond to irrelevant stimuli.  For example, [[prairie dog]]s (''Cynomys ludovicianus'') give alarm calls when predators approach, causing all individuals in the group to quickly scramble down burrows.  When prairie dog towns are located near trails used by humans, giving alarm calls every time a person walks by is expensive in terms of time and energy. Habituation to humans is therefore an important adaptation in this context.<ref name="Breed">{{cite web|url=http://www.animalbehavioronline.com/habituation.html|title=Habituation|author=M.D.Breed|year=2001|accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The MIT encyclopedia of the cognitive sciences|year=2001|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-73144-7|author=Keil, Frank C.|author2=Robert Andrew Wilson|page=184}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Bouton|first=M.E.|title=Learning and behavior: A contemporary synthesis|year=2007|publisher=Sunderland|location=MA, Sinauer|url=http://sites.sinauer.com/bouton/glossary.html#Habituation}}</ref>

===Associative learning===
{{Main|Association (psychology)}}
{{further|Classical conditioning}}
{{further|Operant conditioning}}
Associative learning in animal behaviour is any learning process in which a new response becomes associated with a particular stimulus.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/associative-learning|title=Associative learning|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref> The first studies of associative learning were made by Russian [[physiologist]] [[Ivan Pavlov]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Hudmon|first=Andrew|title=Learning and memory|page=35|isbn=978-0-7910-8638-4|year=2005|publisher=Infobase Publishing}}</ref> Examples  of associative learning include when a goldfish swims to the water surface when a human is going to feed it, or the excitement of a dog whenever it sees a [[leash]] as a prelude for a walk.

===Imprinting===
{{Main|Imprinting (psychology)}}
[[File:Moose-Imprinting-sr81-15.jpg|right|200 px|thumb|Example of [[Imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]] in a [[moose]] ]]
<!-- SHOULD BE MODIFIED TO FIT IN HERE PROPERLY -->
Being able to discriminate the members of one's own species is also of fundamental importance for reproductive success. Such discrimination can be based on a number of factors. However, this important type of learning only takes place in a very limited period of time. This kind of learning is called [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Mercer|first=Jean|title=Understanding attachment: parenting, child care, and emotional development|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-98217-1|page=19}}</ref> and was a second important finding of Lorenz. Lorenz observed that the young of birds such as [[goose|geese]] and [[chicken]]s followed their mothers spontaneously from almost the first day after they were hatched, and he discovered that this response could be imitated by an arbitrary stimulus if the eggs were incubated artificially and the stimulus were presented during a critical period that continued for a few days after hatching.

===Cultural learning===
{{main|Cultural transmission in animals}}

====Observational learning====
{{main|Observational learning}}

====Imitation====
{{main|Imitation}}
[[Imitation]] is an advanced behaviour whereby an animal observes and exactly replicates the behaviour of another.
The National Institutes of Health reported that capuchin monkeys preferred the company of researchers who imitated them to that of researchers who did not. The monkeys not only spent more time with their imitators but also preferred to engage in a simple task with them even when provided with the option of performing the same task with a {{nowrap|non-imitator}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nih.gov/news/health/aug2009/nichd-13.htm|archiveurl=https://wayback.archive.org/web/20090822171642/http://www.nih.gov/news/health/aug2009/nichd-13.htm|archivedate=2009-08-22 |title=Imitation Promotes Social Bonding in Primates, August 13, 2009 News Release - National Institutes of Health (NIH) |publisher=Nih.gov |date=2009-08-13 |accessdate=2011-11-08}}</ref> Imitation has been observed in recent research on chimpanzees; not only did these chimps copy the actions of another individual, when given a choice, the chimps preferred to imitate the actions of the higher-ranking elder chimpanzee as opposed to the lower-ranking young chimpanzee.<ref name="FerrariHorner2010">{{cite journal|last1=Horner|first1=Victoria|author2=etal|title=Prestige Affects Cultural Learning in Chimpanzees|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=5|issue=5|date=19 May 2010|accessdate=9 September 2016|pages=e10625|issn=1932-6203|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0010625}}</ref>

====Stimulus and local enhancement====
There are various ways animals can learn using observational learning but without the process of imitation.  One of these is ''stimulus enhancement'' in which individuals become interested in an object as the result of observing others interacting with the object.<ref>Spence, K.W. (1937). Experimental studies of learning and higher mental processes in infra-human primates. Psychological Bulletin, 34: 806-850</ref> Increased interest in an object can result in object manipulation which allows for new object-related behaviours by trial-and-error learning.  Haggerty (1909) devised an experiment in which a monkey climbed up the side of a cage, placed its arm into a wooden chute, and pulled a rope in the chute to release food. Another monkey was provided an opportunity to obtain the food after watching a monkey go through this process on four separate occasions. The monkey performed a different method and finally succeeded after trial-and-error.<ref>Haggerty, M.E., (1909). Imitation in monkeys. Journal of Comparative Neurology and Psychology, 19: 337-455</ref>  Another example familiar to some cat and dog owners is the ability of their animals to open doors.  The action of humans operating the handle to open the door results in the animals becoming interested in the handle and then by trial-and-error, they learn to operate the handle and open the door.

In local enhancement, a demonstrator attracts an observer's attention to a particular location.<ref name="mechanisms">{{cite book|author1=Hoppitt, W.  |author2=Laland, K.N.|year=2013|title=Social Learning: An Introduction to Mechanisms, Methods, and Models.

====Social transmission====
{{see also|Cultural transmission in animals}}
A well-documented example of social transmission of a behaviour occurred in a group of [[macaque]]s on [[Hachijojima]] Island, Japan. The macaques lived in the inland forest until the 1960s, when a group of researchers started giving them potatoes on the beach: soon, they started venturing onto the beach, picking the potatoes from the sand, and cleaning and eating them.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Edward O.|title=Sociobiology: the new synthesis|page=170|year=2000|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-00089-6}}</ref> About one year later, an individual was observed bringing a potato to the sea, putting it into the water with one hand, and cleaning it with the other. This behaviour was soon expressed by the individuals living in contact with her; when they gave birth, this behaviour was also expressed by their young - a form of social transmission.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blueplanetbiomes.org/japanese_macaque.htm |title=Japanese Macaque - Macaca fuscata |publisher=Blueplanetbiomes.org |accessdate=2011-11-08}}</ref>

===Teaching===
{{see also|Animal culture#Teaching}}
Teaching is a highly specialized aspect of learning in which the "teacher" (demonstrator) adjusts their behaviour to increase the probability of the "pupil" (observer) achieving the desired end-result of the behaviour. For example, [[killer whale]]s are known to intentionally beach themselves to catch [[pinniped]] prey.<ref name=rendell>Rendell, L. and Whitehead, H. (2001). Culture in whales and dolphins. Behavioral and Brain Sciences. 24: 309-24</ref> Mother killer whales teach their young to catch pinnipeds by pushing them onto the shore and encouraging them to attack the prey. Because the mother killer whale is altering her behaviour to help her offspring learn to catch prey, this is evidence of teaching.<ref name=rendell/> Teaching is not limited to mammals. Many insects, for example, have been observed demonstrating various forms of teaching to obtain food. [[Ant]]s, for example, will guide each other to food sources through a process called "[[tandem running]]," in which an ant will guide a companion ant to a source of food.<ref name=hoppit>Hoppitt, W.J., G.R. Brown, R. Kendal, L. Rendell, A. Thornton, M,M, Webster, and K,N, Laland, (2008).  Lessons from animal teaching. Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 23: 486-93</ref> It has been suggested that the pupil ant is able to learn this route to obtain food in the future or teach the route to other ants.This behaviour of teaching is also exemplified by crows. Specifically [[New Caledonian crow]]s. The adults (whether individual or in families) teach their young adolescent offspring how to construct and utilize tools. For example; ''[[Pandanus]]'' branches are used to extract insects and other larvae from holes within trees.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Mating and the fight for supremacy==
Individual [[reproduction]] is the most important phase in the proliferation of individuals or genes within a species: for this reason, there exist complex [[mating]] [[ritual]]s, which can be very complex even if they are often regarded as FAPs. The [[stickleback]]'s complex mating ritual, studied by Tinbergen, is regarded as a notable example of a FAP.

Often in [[social relation|social life]], animals fight for the right to reproduce, as well as social supremacy. A common example of fighting for social and sexual supremacy is the so-called [[pecking order]] among [[poultry]]. Every time a group of poultry cohabitate for a certain time length, they establish a pecking order. In these groups, one chicken dominates the others and can peck without being pecked. A second chicken can peck all the others except the first, and so on. Higher level chickens are easily distinguished by their well-cured aspect, as opposed to lower level chickens. While the pecking order is establishing, frequent and violent fights can happen, but once established, it is broken only when other individuals enter the group, in which case the pecking order re-establishes from scratch.

==Living in groups==
Several animal species, including humans, tend to live in groups. [[Group size measures|Group size]] is a major aspect of their social environment. [[Social relation|Social life]] is probably a complex and effective survival strategy. It may be regarded as a sort of [[symbiosis]] among individuals of the same species: a [[society]] is composed of a group of individuals belonging to the same species living within well-defined rules on [[food]] management, role assignments and reciprocal dependence.

When [[biologist]]s interested in [[evolution theory]] first started examining social behaviour, some apparently unanswerable questions arose, such as how the birth of [[Reproduce|sterile]] [[caste]]s, like in [[bee]]s, could be explained through an evolving mechanism that emphasizes the reproductive success of as many individuals as possible, or why, amongst animals living in small groups like [[squirrel]]s, an individual would risk its own life to save the rest of the group. These behaviours may be examples of [[Altruism (biology)|altruism]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Cummings, Mark |author2=Carolyn Zahn-Waxler |author3=Ronald Iannotti|title=Altruism and aggression: biological and social origins|year=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-42367-0|page=7}}</ref> Of course, not all behaviours are altruistic, as indicated by the table below. For example, revengeful behaviour was at one point claimed to have been observed exclusively in ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. However, other species have been reported to be vengeful, including reports of vengeful camels<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eJFlGdPEBfYC&printsec=frontcover#PPA338,M1 |title=The Ape and the Sushi Master |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 2001-12-27|accessdate=2011-11-08|isbn=978-0-465-04176-3}}</ref> and chimpanzees.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=daomTGYZuW4C&printsec=frontcover#PPA79,M1 |title=Beyond Revenge |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 2008-04-11|accessdate=2011-11-08|isbn=978-0-7879-7756-6}}</ref>

===Benefits and costs of group living===

One advantage of group living can be decreased predation. If the number of predator attacks stays the same despite increasing prey group size, each prey may have a reduced risk of predator attacks through the dilution effect.<ref name=Davies2012>Davies, Nicholas B., Krebs, John R., and West, Stuart A. An Introduction to Behavioral Ecology, 4th ed. Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, 2012.</ref> Additionally, a predator that is confused by a mass of individuals can find it more difficult to single out one target. For this reason, the zebra’s stripes offer not only camouflage in a habitat of tall grasses, but also the advantage of blending into a herd of other zebras.<ref>"How do a zebra’s stripes act as camouflage?"  15 April 2008. HowStuffWorks.com. Accessed 22 April 2014. <http://animals.howstuffworks.com/mammals/question454.htm></ref> In groups, prey can also actively reduce their predation risk through more effective defense tactics, or through earlier detection of predators through increased vigilance.<ref name=Davies2012/>

Another advantage of group living can be an increased ability to forage for food. Group members may exchange information about food sources between one another, facilitating the process of [[Foraging#Group Foraging|resource location]].<ref name=Davies2012/> Honeybees are a notable example of this, using the [[waggle dance]] to communicate the location of flowers to the rest of their hive.<ref>Riley, J.; Greggers, U.; Smith, A.; Reynolds, D.; Menzel, R. (2005) "The flight paths of honeybees recruited by the waggle dance". Nature, 435 (7039): 205–207. Bibcode:2005Natur.435..205R. doi:10.1038/nature03526</ref> Predators also receive benefits from [[Cooperative hunting|hunting in groups]], through using better strategies and being able to take down larger prey.<ref name=Davies2012/>

Some disadvantages accompany living in groups. Living in close proximity to other animals can facilitate the transmission of parasites and disease, and groups that are too large may also experience greater competition for resources and mates.<ref>"A Look at Animal Social Groups." Rathads, Triana. Science 360. R. R. Donnelly, 29 Aug. 2007. Web. Retrieved 22 Apr. 2014. <http://www.sciences360.com/index.php/a-look-at-animal-social-groups-6-23511/>.</ref>

===Group size===

Theoretically, social animals should have optimal group sizes that maximize the benefits and minimize the costs of group living. However, in nature, most groups are stable at slightly larger than optimal sizes.<ref name=Davies2012/> Because it generally benefits an individual to join an optimally-sized group, despite slightly decreasing the advantage for all members, groups may continue to increase in size until it is more advantageous to remain alone than to join an overly full group.<ref>Sibley, R.M. (1983) "Optimal group size is unstable". Animal Behavior, 31: 947-948.</ref>

==Tinbergen's four questions for ethologists==
{{Main|Tinbergen's four questions}}

Niko Tinbergen argued that ethology always needed to include four kinds of explanation in any instance of behaviour:

* Function&nbsp;– How does the behaviour affect the animal's chances of survival and reproduction? Why does the animal respond that way instead of some other way?
* Causation&nbsp;– What are the stimuli that elicit the response, and how has it been modified by recent learning?
* Development&nbsp;– How does the behaviour change with age, and what early experiences are necessary for the animal to display the behaviour?
* Evolutionary history&nbsp;– How does the behaviour compare with similar behaviour in related species, and how might it have begun through the process of [[phylogeny]]?

These explanations are complementary rather than mutually exclusive—all instances of behaviour require an explanation at each of these four levels. For example, the function of eating is to acquire nutrients (which ultimately aids survival and reproduction), but the immediate cause of eating is hunger (causation). Hunger and eating are evolutionarily ancient and are found in many species (evolutionary history), and develop early within an organism's lifespan (development). It is easy to confuse such questions—for example, to argue that people eat because they're hungry and not to acquire nutrients—without realizing that the reason people experience hunger is because it causes them to acquire nutrients.<ref>Barrett et al. (2002) Human Evolutionary Psychology. Princeton University Press.</ref>
